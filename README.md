âš¡ Fun fact: Why Gnatsnapper?
I grew up with an military aviation historian for a father, so I accidentally resorted to using the names of aircraft when I had to come up with an arbitrary name for a project, computer, storage device, etc, and it became a thing.  I always tried to keep this scheme somewhat meaningful, storage devices were always transport aircraft (Hercules, Brittania, Argosy, Beverleyâ€¦), monitoring servers  were always reconnaisance (Nimrod, Canberra, Sentinel...) and computers became combat gilders (Horsa, Hamilcar, Hengist, Hadrian... I just liked the names).  Gnatsnapper comes from a [never mass-produced biplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloster_Gnatsnapper), I liked the obscure name and that it sounds a bit like something that could fix bugs, which I have been known to do.
